# User-Centric Gender Rewriting:
This repo contains code to reproduce the results in our paper [User-Centric Gender Rewriting](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/XXXX).


## Requirements:
The code was written for python>=3.7, pytorch 1.5.1, and transformers 4.11.3. You will need a few additional packages. Here's how you can set up the environment using conda (assuming you have conda and cuda installed):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/balhafni/XXXX.git
cd XXXX

conda create -n gender_rewriting python=3.7
conda activate gender_rewriting

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
